# koin_coroutines_viewmodel_retofit_example

### App that show a list of users from https://randomuser.me/api/ .

Build with **Kotlin**, applying **SOLID** principles and using the Clean Architecture approach. I also implement the **Model View ViewModel** design pattern, which abstracts the user interactions from the business logic. Additionally, I used  **Koin** for dependency injection, **coroutines** for Asynchronous tasks, **Retrofit** and **Okhttp3**, **Material Components** for the "design" and user experience of the app and **Coil** library for image loading.
